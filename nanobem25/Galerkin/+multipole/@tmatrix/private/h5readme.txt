The geometry of the nanoparticle is stored in the nanobem toolbox as follows:

material1 - Soft H5-link to material properties of first  medium
material2 - Soft H5-link to material properties of second medium
...

vertices - Vertices of discreticed particle boundary
faces    - Faces of triangular boundary elements
inout    - Material index at boundary inside and outside
