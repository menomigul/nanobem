%% Multipole fields and T-matrices
%
% With the objects of the +multipole folder it is possible to compute and
% store T-matrices, and to use then in combination with other T-matrix
% software packages such as <https://github.com/tfp-photonics/treams
% treams>. In the T-matrix approach the incoming and scattered fields are
% specified in terms of multipole coefficients *q* and *a*, which are
% connected through the T-matrix *T* via *a*= *T* *q*.
