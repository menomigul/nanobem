%
% The +optics folder contains a number of general classes and functions for
% optics simulations such as
%
% * images obtained in interferometric scattering (iSCAT),
% * coherent bright-field or dark-field microscopy,
% * focused laser excitations,
% * imaging of scattering through cylindrical capillary.
%
% The +optics folder is an add-on to the nanobem toolbox that uses the
% toolbox features but contains no classes or functions that are needed in
% the remaining toolbox. The above figure shows a comparison of a measured
% and simulated iSCAT image.
