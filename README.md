## 📦 About

The NANOBEM25 toolbox provides a MATLAB-based implementation of the **boundary element method (BEM)** tailored for simulating optical properties of nanostructures.

In addition to core BEM functionality, this toolbox includes several **add-ons** developed for:

- **Optical tweezers simulation** — based on extensions described in  
  [ACS Photonics 2015, 2, 1023–1030](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acsphotonics.5c00254)

- **Optofluidic force induction (of2i)** modeling — covering the underlying physics as detailed in  
  [Phys. Rev. Applied 19, 034041 (2023)](https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevApplied.19.034041)

- **Interference microscopy** - extending the capabilities of the toolbox to microscopy and imaging-related tasks often encountered in nanosensing as reported in
  [ACS Photonics 2024, 11, 2745-2756](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acsphotonics.4c00621)


These enhancements make the toolbox suitable not only for nanoplasmonics research, but also for **optical trapping** and **particle characterization** in photonic experiments.
